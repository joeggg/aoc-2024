## Advent of Code 2024

Just tracking my solutions to the advent of code problems so I can access them on any of my devices. 

Writing in Rust as practice for its syntax/way of doing things. Dont judge me too hard on my solutions :P

Run the solution to a day's problem like so: 

```bash
cargo run --bin day-1
```
